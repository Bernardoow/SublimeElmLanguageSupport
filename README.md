- Four standard build commands (<kbd>Super+[Shift]+B</kbd> or <kbd>Super+[Shift]+F7</kbd>)
  1. `Build` just checks errors. Kudos to this [tweet][]!
  2. `Run` additionally outputs your compiled program to an inferred path.
  3. The same as the above two, but ignoring warnings
  4. Output path is configurable in `elm-package.json` or `Elm Build System: …` in the Command Palette. Elm build system only requires a valid config in any ancestor directory of the active file. ![compile messages screenshot](images/elm_project.jpg)
- Compile messages
  1. Navigate errors and warnings (<kbd>Super+[Shift]+F4</kbd>).
  2. Formatted for build output panel.
  3. Compile message highlighting, embedded code highlighting, and color scheme for output panel. ![compile messages screenshot](images/elm_make.jpg)
- Integration with popular plugins (installed separately)
  1. [SublimeREPL][] — Run `elm-repl` in an editor tab with syntax highlighting. ![SublimeREPL screenshot](images/elm_repl.jpg)
- Integration with [elm format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format)
  1. Make sure `elm-format` is in your PATH
  2. Run the "Elm Language Support: Run elm-format" command from the Command Palette to run elm-format on the current file
  3. To enable automatic formatting on every save, Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> Elm Language Support -> Settings and add this setting:
     `"elm_format_on_save": true`
  4. If there are certain Elm source files you don't want to automatically run `elm-format` on, for example elm-css based files, you can set a regex filter which will search the full filename (including the path to the file). If the regex matches, then it will not automatically run `elm-format` on the file when you save. For example, the following filter would prevent automatic `elm-format` on a file named `elm-css/src/Css/TopBar.elm`:
     `"elm_format_filename_filter": "elm-css/src/Css/.*\\.elm$"`![elm-format screenshot](images/elm_format.png)
- Project-specific settings

  Need to configure a setting (such as `elm_format_binary`) per-project? Prefix the name of the setting with `elm_language_support_` and add it to your project settings file.

  ```
  {
    "folders":
    [
      {
        "path": "."
      }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
      "elm_language_support_elm_format_binary": "node_modules/elm-format/unpacked_bin/elm-format"
    }
  }
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- I have `elm-oracle` installed, but completions, type signature display, and the type panel don't work
  1. Make sure `elm-oracle` is on your PATH, or
  2. Add the absolute path of the directory containing `elm-oracle` to the `elm_paths` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings
- I have `elm-format` installed, but it's not working
  1. Make sure `elm-format` is on your PATH, or
  2. Add the absolute path of the directory containing `elm-format` to the `elm_paths` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings. Note that you can combine paths with `:`, for example `"elm_paths": "/users/alex/elm-format/bin:/users/alex/elm-oracle/bin"`.
  3. If using an alternate name for the binary (`elm-format-0.19`), adjust the `elm_format_binary` setting in your Elm Language Support User settings. This can be relative to your project directory. For example, if you want to use the NPM package version of `elm-format` installed locally in your project, use `"elm_format_binary": "node_modules/elm-format/unpacked_bin/elm-format"`.
- Elm format automatically runs every time I save a file, but there are some files I don't want it to run on
  1. If there are certain Elm source files you don't want to automatically run `elm-format` on, for example elm-css based files, you can set a regex filter which will search the full filename (including the path to the file). If the regex matches, then it will not automatically run `elm-format` on the file when you save. For example, the following filter would prevent automatic `elm-format` on a file named `elm-css/src/Css/TopBar.elm`:
     `"elm_format_filename_filter": "elm-css/src/Css/.*\\.elm$"`
