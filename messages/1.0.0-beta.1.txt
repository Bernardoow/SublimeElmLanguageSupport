New in Elm Language Support 1.0.0-beta.1 (August 22, 2018)
==========================================================

This prerelease version provides experimental support for the just-released
Elm 0.19, and BREAKS COMPATIBILITY with Elm 0.18 and earlier.

Read about Elm 0.19 here:

What's New
----------

The following features have been removed, as they depend on elm-oracle, which
has not yet been updated to support Elm 0.19:

 - Removed: Display type signatures for symbols under the cursor in the status
   bar.
 - Removed: Elm type info panel (alt/option-up/down keyboard shortcuts).
 - Removed: Autocompletion of Elm symbols available in the current module.

The build system was rewritten to support the new output format of the Elm 0.19
compiler. The following features have yet to be reimplemented:

 - Removed: Support for enabling/disabling build warnings (Elm 0.19 has removed
   compiler warnings for now).
 - Removed: Ability to build your whole project to an output file from within
   Sublime Text. For now, the build system builds only the current module (and
   everything it imports), which is sufficient for getting quick compiler
   feedback on the code you're working on. But to actually run your all, you'll
   need some other way of running a build of your whole project for now.

And there is one new feature that will come in handy for those of you juggling
multiple Elm versions on your machine:

 - New: `elm_binary` setting that lets you override the path and filename to the
   Elm binary file (`elm`) that Sublime Text uses to build your code.
